Exploring functions.

## Attained Knowledge
* Functions are defined with the `fn` reserved word.
* In RUST functions take typed parameters. `fn my_function(x: i32) {}`
* Return types are specified with an `->` `fn my_function(x: i32) -> {}`
* Function bodys contain a series of statements that optionally end with an expression.
* expressions are statements that return a value without a semicolon. `x + 1`
