Conditional branching.

## Attained Knowledge
* if statements a do not require brackets. `if i < 2 {` 
* if statements can be written as one liners for turnery operations. `let x = if y < 2 {y} else {"none"};` 
* Conditional loops also do not require brackets. `while i < 5 {`
* For loops can operate on iterators `for element in array.iter() {`
* `.rev()` can be called on iterators to reverse the direction of iteration.
* a for in range loop looks like this. `for i in 1..=10 {`
